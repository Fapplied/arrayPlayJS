# arrayPlayJS
Play with arrays at salt
Todays exercise is to play around and get data form this json-string using javascript and a lot of array-methods!
Copy the content as a string into a new JS project then call JSON.parse() on the string, saving it into a constant! https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_parse.asp
After that we want you to search through and get specific information using array-methods, feel free to add new challenges you see fit but these you have to try:

Get all people who live in a specific city, ordered by age

Get all people who live in the city with the most people in it

Get all children of everyone who lives in a specific city ordered by age

Get all people with a name that starts with L and has children

Get all people who had children before they turned 30

Get all people who have children aged 10 or older, ordered by name of the child

Get all names of the people in a specific city ordered by the last name

Get all females who has kids

Get everyone above the age of 65 who doesn’t have kids.

Get all males over 45 who doesn’t have kids and live in a specific city

Hope you play around and have some fun as well!
